# LangGraph Course

Repository for all of the code written for the FreeCodeCamp LangGraph Course, including solutions for all exercises. This repo provides practical examples of using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) for building agent-based applications through Python scripts and interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview

LangGraph is a Python framework for designing and managing the flow of tasks in your application using graph structures. This course demonstrates LangGraph concepts through step-by-step exercises, agent implementations, and Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository Structure

```

├── Agents/            # Python agents for various tasks (e.g., RAG_Agent, Drafter)
├── Exercises/         # Jupyter notebooks with exercise solutions
├── Graphs/            # Jupyter notebooks illustrating LangGraph concepts

**Notable Directories:**
- **Agents/**: Python scripts for agents such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and document drafting.
- **Exercises/**: Jupyter notebooks for each exercise (e.g. `Exercise_Graph1.ipynb`).
- **Graphs/**: Notebooks demonstrating LangGraph patterns (e.g., Hello World, Looping).

## Getting Started (zsh/Mac)

### Using pyenv and uv

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/rdtiv/LangGraph-Course.git
cd LangGraph-Course
```

#### 2. Install pyenv (if not already installed)

```zsh
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` if it's not already there:

```zsh
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
Restart your terminal or source your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### 3. Install Python Version

```zsh
pyenv install 3.12.6
pyenv local 3.12.6
```

#### 4. Install uv

```zsh
pipx install uv           # Recommended, or:
pip install --user uv
```

If you don't have pipx, install it with:

```zsh
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

#### 5. Set Up Virtual Environment with uv

```zsh
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 6. Install Dependencies

```zsh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 7. (Optional) Set up Environment Variables

If you need API keys (such as for OpenAI), create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```zsh
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key" > .env
# Add other variables as needed
```

#### 8. Start JupyterLab

```zsh
uv pip install jupyterlab  # Only if not already installed
jupyter lab
```

---

## Usage

- Open and run Jupyter notebooks in `Graphs/` and `Exercises/` for hands-on practice and exploration.
- Run agent scripts in `Agents/` for more advanced experiments.
- All code is designed to work in a local, isolated Python environment managed by pyenv and uv.

---

## Exercises

- Explore the `Exercises/` directory for self-contained solutions to LangGraph problems.
- Example notebooks:
  - `Exercise_Graph1.ipynb`: Agent state and basic graph usage.
  - `Exercise_Graph2.ipynb`: User input and graph visualization.
  - `Exercise_Graph3.ipynb`: Personalization and skills-based responses.
  - `Exercise_Graph4.ipynb`, `Exercise_Graph5.ipynb`: Advanced graph operations.
