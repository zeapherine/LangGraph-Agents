Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to attend the scheduled meeting at 10:00 AM at Canary Wharf due to unforeseen circumstances. However, I am available to meet at 12:00 PM in New York the next day. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

Please let me know if there are any key points or updates that I should be aware of, and feel free to share any materials or notes from the meeting.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Vaibhav
